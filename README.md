# Greenhouse-Garden
### Arduino-controlled Plant/Pot watering timers for mini-greenhouse and outdoor hanging pots.
#### My first little program (needs checkin) was a watering and fan controller for a portable greenhouse, there's a video somewhere (needs link)
#### Second start on this project (also needs checkin) is for a larger greenhouse. Starting with two donated 12V lead-acid batteries, a Zamp Solar Panel w/ charge controller, a (brand-x) Charge/Discharge Controller, DHT11 temp/humidity sensor and some Relays for some higher power switching, we're gonna try to keep the solarium from getting higher than specified temps. 
#####   After the fans, I hope to add connection to in-house wifi, data logging either on-board or on a local web service-like service, watering, yadda yadda dreams.
